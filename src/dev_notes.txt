BUGS

When in 'STEP' simspeed, when Space is pressed the sim immediately steps once forward, but clicking "PAUSE" forces a duration-wait.

Following minimalism overhaul, re-selecting the current toolbox tool does not deselect it.

x   -   Camera target doesn't update with resolution change / GUI resize
x   -   Camera frustrum doesn't update with GUI resize
x   -   GUI sizing still doesn't update after gameplay->options->updateResolution->gameplay sequence. Font okay though.
x   -   World coords of lower-right corner of cam frustum not being recalculated properly; constantly set to grid's absolute last corner.
x   -   GUI sizing doesn't update (despite calling the function) after returning from Options screen.
